However, there will be times, due to size of item(s) Quantity of Item(s), staff availability etc. that you may need to make arrangements with a Third-party shipper. That is why, if you plan to purchase an item and NEED it shipped that you contact our office prior to bidding and no later than the close of the auction to see if we can accommodate your request. THANK YOU! Calling is generally the best option to be sure we are all on the same page."

We will attempt to combine items into as few parcels as reasonably possible to reduce the shipping costs. Pacific Northwest Auction cannot estimate shipping costs and until items are boxed for shipping, we will not know the cost of shipping. We charge what the carrier charges us with NO markup. All purchases will be shipped to the buyers via USPS or UPS Ground, FedEx etc. depending on size of parcel (we reserve the right to select the shipper). If you would prefer to make your own shipping arrangements and send us a label for your item(s) simply contact us and let us know."

If the standard insurance coverage from the carrier (USPS, UPS etc.) is higher than the invoiced value of the items being shipped, we will not purchase additional insurance. If the item(s) being shipped exceed the standard insurance value offered by the shipper additional insurance will be purchased and charged to you on your invoice. If you purchase an item and feel that it is valued higher than the invoiced purchase price you will need to call our office and request additional insurance coverage along with the amount you would like your shipment insured for."
