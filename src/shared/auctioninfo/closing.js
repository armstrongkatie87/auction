That lot will remain open until there are no bids on that item during the extended time period(s). This only affects lots that receive a bid during the last FIVE minutes of the auction. Any lot not bid on in the last five minutes will close as scheduled. Example: If you are participating in an auction that closes at 6:00 PM and you place a bid at 5:55, that lot will extend until 6:05 p.m. and will keep extending in Five-minute increments at time a new bid is placed. It will stop extending when no bid has been placed during the extended time period(s)."

You can place a max bid at any time in the place bid space by simply entering the highest number you want to bid. When you place a MAX BID, the current bid price will only go to the next increment, or one increment over someone elses max bid if one has been placed. The computer will bid for you in the pre-determined auction increments up to your highest dollar entered only if someone else bids against you to raise your bid to that dollar amount."

If you have reached your MAX BID and are still not the current high Bidder, the system will give you the opportunity to enter another MAX BID."

        text: "Bids will be placed in the order that they are received. If TWO buyers enter a BID of the same dollar amount, the buyer who entered his/her BID FIRST will be the bidder that is in at that price. If you bid a certain amount and see that the bid is indeed that amount, but you are not the 'Winning Bidder', that means that someone else had a max bid of that amount and so their bid was placed into the system ahead of yours. The best way to know if you are out is to check your email as you should get an email every time you are outbid."

If you are not able to be around a computer/ mobile device during the closing of the auction or receive and/or read your outbid notices, we HIGHLY RECOMMEND you utilize the max bidding feature. Please remember, you can always raise your max bid, but you CANNOT lower it."

Do not wait until the last minute to bid; if the system is busy, your bids may not process within the last seconds of an auction closing."
